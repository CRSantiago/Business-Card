            <p>I'm Chris, and I am currently a Web Developer at The Education Foundation of Osceola County. I am also a full-time student at UCF pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. My busy schedule does not keep me from working on projects I am passionate about. My go to technology stack is Javascript and Python. However, I always seek new tools to add to the tool belt.</p>
